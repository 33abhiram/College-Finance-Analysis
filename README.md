This project showcases all finances during my freshman year of college. I made this project since I was curious about how I managed my money during my first year being independent and I definitely learnt a lot! In summary, I must implement a solid monthly budget, cut down my shopping expenses and ensure my balance does not fall below the minimum. All in all, I clearly wasted a lot of money, but I'm glad I made this dashboard since it will help me better manage my finances for the years to come.
